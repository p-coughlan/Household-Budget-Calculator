    Development Issues:
    
    Arrays for Income and Object for Expenditure - Why?

    Separate Income and Expenditure functions both targeting all input data in table - how did I fix this?

    During testing of the table inputs I was getting incorrect calculations - how did I find this? Attributable to incorrect if else statements that converted the frequency to a base figure.

    Parse float - why did I use this?
