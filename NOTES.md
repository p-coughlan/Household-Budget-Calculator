    Development Issues:
    
    Arrays for Income and Object for Expenditure - Why?

    Separate Income and Expenditure functions both targeting all input data in table - how did I fix this?

    During testing of the table inputs I was getting incorrect calculations - how did I find this? Attributable to incorrect if else statements that converted the frequency to a base figure.

    Parse float - why did I use this?

    Ensuring the input field only accepts numbers by using a regular expression - explain this:
    <input type="number" placeholder="Â£0.00" oninput="this.value = this.value.replace(/[^0-9.]/g, '')">

PREVIOUS ARRAY STRUCTURE

this method enables easier operation due to logically labelled keys and values

// Expenditure array conatining objects with arrays of items. Each object has a key (category) and an array of items (sub categories, frequency, amount)
const expenditures = [
  // Array of expenditure categories as objects
  // example
  //{
  // "category": [ // key
  // ["sub category", "frequency", amount], (value)
  // ["sub category", "frequency", amount],
  // ["sub category", "frequency", amount],
  // ],
  // },
  {
    "HOUSEHOLD BILLS": [
      // category (key) access by expenditures[0]["HOUSEHOLD BILLS"]
      ["Mortgage or Rent", "weekly", 0], // access by expenditures[0]["HOUSEHOLD BILLS"][0][2]
      ["Council Tax", "weekly", 0], // access by expenditures[0]["HOUSEHOLD BILLS"][1][2]
      ["Maintenance", "weekly", 0], // access by expenditures[0]["HOUSEHOLD BILLS"][2]
      ["Utility Bills", "weekly", 0], // access by expenditures[0]["HOUSEHOLD BILLS"][3]
      ["Other Household Costs", "weekly", 0], // access by expenditures[0]["HOUSEHOLD BILLS"][4]
